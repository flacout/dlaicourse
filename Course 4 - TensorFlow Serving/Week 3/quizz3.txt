1. Store them in a log file and use epoch-by-epoch callbacks to update it. Have Tensorboard read that log file
2. during model.fit() process
3. tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard
4. Set histogram_freq=1
5. tensorboard dev upload --logdir ./logs
6. tensorboard.dev/experiment/[code]
7. tf.summary.image() -- with image as a parameter
8. %tensorboard --logdir logs/train_data
9. tf.keras.callbacks.LambdaCallback
10. tf.summary
