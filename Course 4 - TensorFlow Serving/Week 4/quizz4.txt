1. All of the above
2. Devices report only the data needed for a specific computation
3. Devices in a network pair up, and create obfuscation keys that get cancelled out when aggregated on the server
4. Itâ€™s designed to allow the expression of new Federated algorithms
5. You declare the type as {float32}@clients
6. Attribute the function with @tff.federated_computation
7. You have to use a tff.federated_mean to calculate the value and return its results
8. Pip install tensorflow_federated
